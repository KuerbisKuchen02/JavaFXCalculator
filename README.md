# JavaFX Calculator

> Simple calculator built with Java and JavaFX. 

It works by:
- **Parsing Expressions:** Uses an LR(1) grammar and the Shunting Yard Algorithm to convert mathematical expressions into Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).
- **Calculating Results:** Evaluates the RPN expression with a stack-based approach to get the final result.
- **User Interface:** Features a straightforward JavaFX interface for entering expressions and viewing results.

This project demonstrates basic parsing and calculation techniques for handling arithmetic expressions.
